Serge talked about @cachedjit (see https://gist.github.com/serge-sans-paille/28c86d2b33cd561ba5e50081716b2cf4)

It's indeed a good idea.

With "# pythran import" and @used_by_cachedjit the implementation should not be
too complicated.

- At import time, we create one .py file per cachedjit function.

- At run time, we create (and complete when needed) a corresponding
  .pythran file with signature(s).

  The cachedjit decorator:

  * at the first call, get the types, create the .pythran file and call
    Pythran.

  * then, try to call the pythran function and if it fails with
    a Pythran TypeError, correct the .pythran file and recompile.

Note: it's going to be very slow the first time and each time there is a
Pythran type error. During the compilation, the Python function is used.

Note (NotImplemented): it should also be possible to use type hints to get at
the first compilation more than one signature.
